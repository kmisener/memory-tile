 The app will then randomly shuffle the 30 card deck and place the cards on the game board face down. The user will choose a card the card will then be flipped
 over for the user to see. Next the user will choose another card on the game board trying to match the first card chosen. If the card are a match they will
 remain flipped over and will no longer be selectable. If they are not a match they will both be flipped back over. This will continute until the user has
 matched all the cards in the deck._
